## Using the file system
In the last section, we looked at navigating and reading the file system. Now we're going to make some changes. For this section, you're going to make all the changes, and then we'll paste the state of the directory at the bottom of the page in the last question. 

#### Q1
Use the `touch` command to create a new file called `answer1.txt`

#### Q2
Use the `cp` command to make a copy of `answer1.txt` called `answer2.txt`

#### Q3
Use the `mv` command to rename `rename-me.txt` to `answer3.txt`.

#### Q4
Use the `mkdir` command to create three directories named `1`, `2`, `3` and `4`.

#### Q5
Use the `mv` command to move each answer file into it's own directory (`answer1.txt` into 1, `answer2.txt` into 2 etc).

#### Q6
As we created too many directories, use the `rmdir` command to delete the spare directory (`4`).

#### Q7
We don't need the `.hidden-file.txt` file in the `extra-dir` directory. Use the `rm` command to delete it.

#### Q8
We don't need the `extra-dir2` directory or any of the files inside it. Use a single `rm` command to delete the directory and all of it's contents (and paste the command you used below!).
```sh
# your answer here

```

#### Q9
We should tidy up the directory a bit. Use the `mkdir` and `mv` commands to create an `answers` directory and move the `1`, `2` and `3` directories into it.

#### Q10
Use a single `cp` command to create a replica of the `extra-dir` directory and all of it's contents, called `extra-dir3` (and paste the command you used below!).
```sh
# your answer here

```

#### FINALLY
Run the command `ls -a **/*` to dump out the full contents of this directory, and paste in the output below. We'll check to see if you've done all the steps right!
```sh
# your answer here

```
