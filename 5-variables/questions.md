## Variables
Variables are useful tools that help us re-use code with slight variances

#### Q1
Use the `=` assignment operator to create a variable called `FIRST_NAME`, and set the value as a string containing your first name.

#### Q2
Use the `=` assignment operator to create a variable called `LAST_NAME`, and set the value as a string containing your last name.

#### Q3
Use the `=` assignment operator to create a variable called `FULL_NAME`, and set the value by using the first two variables you've created in Q1 and Q2, separated by a space. Do not type the values themselves, call the variables! Paste the command you used below!
```sh
# your answer here

```

#### Q4
Use the `=$()` command substitution operator to create a variable called `TASK_DIRECTORY` containing the full path or your current working directory.

#### Q5
Change to a different directory, and use your `TASK_DIRECTORY` variable to create a file called `file.txt` in this directory from the command line and paste your command below!
```sh
# your answer here

```

#### Q6
Use the `export` built-in command to export all of the new variables you have created in this section.

#### FINALLY
Run the `check.sh` script to check that you've done it all correctly! Just type (or copy/paste) `./check.sh` to run the script.
